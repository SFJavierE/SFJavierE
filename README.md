## üöÄ My Professional Journey

My journey into the digital world began as a **Web Developer**, where I had the opportunity to explore and master various facets of development. My path spanned from **creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces on the frontend**, utilizing technologies such as React, Typescript, Angular, etc, to **building robust and efficient logic on the backend**, employing languages and frameworks like ExpressJS, NodeJS, RubyOnRails.

This multifaceted experience provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle and allowed me to develop a **strong capacity for continuous learning and remarkable adaptability** to new technologies and challenges. Furthermore, my role as a **Development Team Lead** significantly strengthened my **communication, collaboration, and project management skills**, learning to coordinate efforts, foster a positive work environment, and achieve common goals.

My time in web development not only equipped me with a valuable set of technical tools but also **deeply integrated me into the dynamic digital world**, cultivating a passion for innovation and solving complex problems.

## üéÆ My Present: Game Developer

Now, I have channeled that passion and experience towards a field that has always resonated with me: **Game Development**. This transition provides me with the exciting opportunity to dedicate myself to projects that genuinely inspire me and allow me to apply the technical and soft skills I have acquired throughout my career. I am utilizing the tools and knowledge I gained on my path as a web developer to create interactive and captivating experiences in the gaming world.

I am currently exploring UnrealEngine5 and Multiplaying Technologies. I am enthusiastic about continuing to grow and contribute to the creation of immersive virtual worlds and memorable gaming experiences.

## üéØ Objectives

My primary objective as a game developer is to **contribute significantly to the creation and maintenance of game engines**. I am enthusiastic about the idea of bringing my experience and knowledge to the development community, whether by working on existing engines and improving them, or even embarking on the challenging project of **building my own engine**.

While my current focus is firmly on game development and, in particular, engine engineering, I maintain my priorities as a professional developer. This means that **I will continue to undertake projects that demonstrate my versatility, my technical skills, and my ability to tackle complex challenges** in various areas of software development. I believe that this duality enriches my profile and allows me to continue growing as a professional in the broad spectrum of technology.
